              The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (Polish: Wiedźmin 3: Dziki Gon, English:
              The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt) is a computer game in the action/RPG
              genre, developed and published by the Polish studio CD Projekt
              RED. The game was originally released on May 19, 2015 on Windows,
              PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, then on October 15, 2019 on Nintendo
              Switch, and on December 14, 2022 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
              X/S. It is a sequel to The Witcher (2007) and The Witcher 2:
              Assassins of Kings (2011). This is the third game set in the
              literary universe of the Witcher book series created by Polish
              writer Andrzej Sapkowski, and the last to follow the adventures of
              Geralt of Rivia. The fantasy game, whose world is based on Slavic
              mythology, tells the story of the witcher Geralt of Rivia, a
              monster hunter whose adopted daughter Ciri is in danger, being
              pursued by the Wild Hunt - a mysterious otherworldly force whose
              secret is revealed as the game progresses. Skip to section "#Plot"
              Many details of the plot refer to the books written by Sapkowski,
              but the plot remains connected to the first two parts and brings
              to a conclusion the trilogy begun by the first game, released
              eight years earlier. Unlike previous games, The Witcher 3 takes
              place in an open world and focuses on using Geralt's combat and
              detective skills to complete orders and explore the environment.
              All of this is part of a multi-level main quest with many side
              missions, which can be completed with 36 different endings. Skip
              to the "#Gameplay" section The game was developed over three and a
              half years on a budget close to the budgets of AAA games of large
              Western studios.

            <p>
              Novigrad (orig. Novigrad) is a city-state and the largest human
              settlement in the Northern Kingdoms, located in the delta of the
              Pontar River in the territory of the kingdom of Redania. It has
              the status of a “Free City” and is a vassal of the Redanian crown,
              in connection with which the hierarch faces a number of
              obligations spelled out in the act of founding the Free City of
              Novigrad in 1065[1]. Being the largest port of the Continent, the
              city is rightly called the “capital of the world” and the center
              of culture. The population of the city, according to rough
              estimates, is 30,000 inhabitants, of which about 6,000 are
              non-humans[1]. The cult of the Eternal Flame is widespread in the
              city. Power is represented by the hierarch Hemmelfart.
